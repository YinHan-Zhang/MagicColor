## News

- 2025-3-15: ðŸŽŠ source code release !

## Overview
We present MagicColor, a diffusion-based framework for multi-instance sketch colorization. Previous methods can only achieve multi-instance sketch colorization step by step, which is time-consuming and inaccurate. In contrast, our method has the capability of coloring sketches while maintaining consistency, making multi-instance sketch colorization easier.
